				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Hi, my name is Redon and I live in Prishtina. I made this site for a couple of reasons: 
					it was the final project in a recent Scrimba course I took, and secondly because I thought
					 that something along these lines should exist. Although I wasn’t born in Prishtina, 
					 I have lived here for the majority of my life, and it is my belief that many travellers
					  should consider this city when visiting our region.</p>
